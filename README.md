Tomato Games was designed so you and your friends can play games during class, without getting caught.
Here's how it works, the title of every page except for the homepage, is "Encylcopedia Britannica | Britannica". This way, when you leave the tab, it will say Encylcopedia Britannica | Britannica on the tab and your teachers will be CLUELESS.
Another cool trick: "k"
By pressing "k" on your keyboard, it will switch tabs for some computers. However, if you don't have any tabs open, it will open a Google Classroom. 
Some computers require you to click on the gray area out side of the game container before pressing "k". Either way, we can confirm this is teacher free and gaming safe.

Have fun and let's start gaming.
